# Time Calculator

This is a program that adds a duration time to a start time. The result is then formatted to indicate how many days have passed. 

    Input: 11:43 AM, 00:20
    Output: 12:03 PM

    Input: 10:10 PM, 3:30
    Output 1:40 AM (next day)

Optionally, the program can also take an input of a start day. The output is also reformatted to display the day after the duration has passed. 

    Input: 11:30 AM, 2:32, Monday
    Output: 2:02 PM, Monday
